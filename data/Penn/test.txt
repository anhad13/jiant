 quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene @@UNKNOWN@@ used to make garbage bags milk @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ toys and meat packaging among other items 
 in the u.s. polyethylene market quantum has claimed the largest share about N N 
 but its competitors including dow chemical co. union carbide corp. and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better @@UNKNOWN@@ against price swings 
 when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound quantum 's annual profit @@UNKNOWN@@ by about N cents a share provided no other @@UNKNOWN@@ are changing 
 in recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive 
 benchmark grades which still sold for as much as N cents a pound last spring have skidded to between N cents and N cents 
 meanwhile the price of @@UNKNOWN@@ the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped nearly so fast 
 that @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its @@UNKNOWN@@ needs 
 by many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year 
 china which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ that excess polyethylene would soon be @@UNKNOWN@@ around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product 
 kenneth mitchell director of dow 's polyethylene business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices @@UNKNOWN@@ up 
 people were even @@UNKNOWN@@ bags he says 
 now producers hope prices have hit bottom 
 they recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks 
 no one knows however whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 one @@UNKNOWN@@ is george @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ analyst at oppenheimer & co. and a bear on plastics stocks 
 noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained he remarks some say october 
 some say november 
 i say N 
 he argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity 
 a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy 
 the company is trying to carry out a three-year $ N billion @@UNKNOWN@@ program started this year 
 at the same time its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ @@UNKNOWN@@ special dividend earlier this year 
 quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the @@UNKNOWN@@ with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases 
 some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to @@UNKNOWN@@ takeover speculation 
 whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend raised N N to N cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ dividend questions in a sept. N meeting with analysts 
 some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives 
 but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual @@UNKNOWN@@ performance 
 in any case on the day of the meeting quantum 's shares slid $ N to $ N in big board trading 
 on top of everything else quantum @@UNKNOWN@@ a disaster at its plant in morris ill 
 after an explosion @@UNKNOWN@@ the plant in june the company @@UNKNOWN@@ in september to within N hours of completing the @@UNKNOWN@@ process of @@UNKNOWN@@ it 
 then a second explosion occurred 
 two workers died and six remain in the hospital 
 this human toll adds the most painful @@UNKNOWN@@ yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes 
 until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up @@UNKNOWN@@ safety @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another @@UNKNOWN@@ into quantum 's financial future 
 when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand @@UNKNOWN@@ lost profit and thus claims under @@UNKNOWN@@ insurance is @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 but the numbers become @@UNKNOWN@@ and subject to @@UNKNOWN@@ between insured and insurer when demand is shifting 
 you say you could have sold x percent of this product and @@UNKNOWN@@ percent of that recalls @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ an analyst at shearson lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer 
 and then you still have to negotiate 
 quantum hopes the morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year 's end 
 the plant usually accounts for N N to N N of quantum 's polyethylene production and N N of its @@UNKNOWN@@ production 
 not everything looks grim for quantum 
 the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's @@UNKNOWN@@ in the polyethylene business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity 
 by lifting @@UNKNOWN@@ production the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs 
 quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing 
 through a venture with its investment banker first boston corp. quantum completed in august an acquisition of @@UNKNOWN@@ inc. in a transaction valued at $ N billion 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ is the second-largest propane distributor in the u.s. 
 the largest suburban propane was already owned by quantum 
 still quantum has a crisis to get past right now 
 some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor

 the spokesman said rjr is discussing its @@UNKNOWN@@ plans with its two main advertising firms @@UNKNOWN@@ katz and @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost said the spokesman who declined to specify how much rjr spends on network television time 
 an executive close to the company said rjr is spending about $ N million on network television time this year down from roughly $ N million last year 
 the spokesman said the broadcast unit will be @@UNKNOWN@@ dec. N and the move wo n't affect rjr 's print radio and @@UNKNOWN@@ buying practices 
 the broadcast group had been based in new york until a year ago when rjr 's previous management moved it to atlanta the company 's headquarters before this summer 
 one employee with the group said rjr moved N employees of the group back to new york in september because there was supposed to be a future 
 he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies 
 the rjr spokesman said the company moved the N employees to new york last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' @@UNKNOWN@@ season

 the u.s. which is @@UNKNOWN@@ its @@UNKNOWN@@ quotas is @@UNKNOWN@@ a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively @@UNKNOWN@@ steel industries

 brazil similar to mexico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u.s. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas which expired sept. N 
 brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u.s. for the year ending oct. N N 
 in recent years u.s. steelmakers have supplied about N N of the N million tons of steel used annually by the nation 
 of the remaining N N needed the @@UNKNOWN@@ negotiations @@UNKNOWN@@ about N N to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n't included in the quota program 
 other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the u.s. such as taiwan sweden and argentina also have supplied steel 
 some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u.s. that are similar to quotas 
 the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N 
 it also said it would use that @@UNKNOWN@@ year period to work toward an international consensus on @@UNKNOWN@@ up the international steel trade which has been @@UNKNOWN@@ managed subsidized and protected by governments 
 the u.s. termed its plan a trade @@UNKNOWN@@ program despite the fact that it is merely an extension 
 mexico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u.s. virtually doubled its quota to N N of the u.s. steel market from N N under the previous quotas 
 south korea which had N N under the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about N N 
 that increase rises to slightly more than N N of the u.s. market if a joint @@UNKNOWN@@ steel project is included 
 meanwhile brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the N N share it has had in recent years 
 the ec and japan the u.s. 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent 
 the ec steel industry which has been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about N N of the u.s. market compared with recent quotas of about N N 
 japan has been shipping steel to total about N N of the u.s. market compared with a quota of N N 
 in the recent talks the ec had its quota increased about N tons to N N of the u.s. market from N N in N 
 but its quota has been as high as N N in N 
 japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about N N from N N previously 
 japan the ec brazil mexico and south korea provide about N N of the steel imported to the u.s. under the quota program 
 the balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters such as australia and venezuela 
 the u.s. had about an extra N N of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks 
 that was essentially made up of a N N increase in the overall quota program and N N from cutting japan 's allowance 
 negotiators from the white house trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another N N of the u.s. steel market to @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 these @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration 's @@UNKNOWN@@ program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and @@UNKNOWN@@ from their own steel industries

 george @@UNKNOWN@@ chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ N million

 procter & gamble co. plans to begin testing next month a @@UNKNOWN@@ detergent that will require only a few @@UNKNOWN@@ per @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the move stems from @@UNKNOWN@@ learned in japan where local competitors have had @@UNKNOWN@@ success with concentrated @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals such as @@UNKNOWN@@ corp. may bring their @@UNKNOWN@@ to the u.s. 
 the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when @@UNKNOWN@@ introduced a powerful detergent called attack which quickly won a N N stake in the japanese markets 
 they do n't want to get caught again says one industry @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 retailers in phoenix ariz. say p&g 's new @@UNKNOWN@@ detergent to be called @@UNKNOWN@@ with color guard will be on shelves in that market by early november 
 a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month

 @@UNKNOWN@@ are n't entirely new for p&g 
 the company introduced a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in japan after watching the success of attack 
 when attack hit the shelves in N p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about N N from more than N N 
 with the help of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ p&g 's share is now estimated to be N N 
 while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p&g will be in the $ N billion u.s. detergent market where growth is slow and @@UNKNOWN@@ have gained @@UNKNOWN@@ over @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the company may have chosen to market the product under the @@UNKNOWN@@ name since it 's already expanded its @@UNKNOWN@@ tide into N different @@UNKNOWN@@ including this year 's big hit tide with @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 with @@UNKNOWN@@ however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much detergent into the @@UNKNOWN@@ machine @@UNKNOWN@@ that it takes a cup of @@UNKNOWN@@ to really clean the @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 in the early 1980s p&g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the @@UNKNOWN@@ brand name that it markets in europe 
 but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in a market test in denver and was dropped 
 p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ but they have n't sold well despite the convenience 
 but p&g contends the new @@UNKNOWN@@ is a unique formula that also offers an @@UNKNOWN@@ that prevents colors from @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 and retailers are expected to @@UNKNOWN@@ the product in part because it will take up less shelf space 
 when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ an analyst at salomon @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 but with so many brands @@UNKNOWN@@ for space that 's no longer the case 
 if the new @@UNKNOWN@@ sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 then retailers will probably push the @@UNKNOWN@@ brands out altogether he says 
 competition is bound to get tougher if @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ a product like attack in the u.s.

 this is something p&g would do with or without @@UNKNOWN@@ says mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u.s. trade representative carla hills

 mrs. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary robert a. mosbacher 
 mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade 
 he said such results should be @@UNKNOWN@@ in dollars and cents in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan 
 but mrs. hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blueprint for action 
 she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months 
 american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach @@UNKNOWN@@ mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills

 the oil industry 's @@UNKNOWN@@ profits could @@UNKNOWN@@ through the rest of the year 
 major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability 
 the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance 
 the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals glenn cox president of phillips petroleum co. said in an interview 
 that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added 
 he did n't forecast phillips 's results 
 but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies @@UNKNOWN@@ by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings 
 so too many analysts predict will exxon corp. chevron corp. and amoco corp 
 typical is what happened to the price of @@UNKNOWN@@ a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies 
 it has plunged N N since july to around N cents a pound 
 a year ago @@UNKNOWN@@ sold for N cents @@UNKNOWN@@ at about N cents last december 
 a big reason for the chemical price retreat is @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 beginning in @@UNKNOWN@@ prices began accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand 
 companies added capacity @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower 
 third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker 
 refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william @@UNKNOWN@@ a securities analyst at first boston corp 
 oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period 
 in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further @@UNKNOWN@@ profitability 
 refiners say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth quarter 
 during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits 
 crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year 
 prices averaging roughly $ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations 
 demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically @@UNKNOWN@@ in the fourth quarter 
 we could see higher oil prices this year said @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ an analyst at painewebber inc 
 that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter 
 while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse 
 in the third quarter they averaged about N N less than they were in N 
 the main reason remains weather 
 last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to @@UNKNOWN@@ more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air @@UNKNOWN@@ use 
 this summer on the other hand had @@UNKNOWN@@ weather than usual 
 we 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said mr. cox phillips 's president 
 the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected 
 going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from N N to N N lower than a year earlier 
 for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand cubic feet down N N from $ N a thousand cubic feet a year ago

 to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft 
 the london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ N million in @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry 
 olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in N 
 a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom but declined to confirm any details

 president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week 
 olivetti has denied that it violated cocom rules @@UNKNOWN@@ that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities 
 although the @@UNKNOWN@@ of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better @@UNKNOWN@@ to support the position of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ in the pentagon and the intelligence community 
 it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies

 while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party 
 salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to cover its entire position 
 bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk 
 the hong kong telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in europe the bankers added because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the hong kong market that has international appeal

 when justice william @@UNKNOWN@@ marks the start of his @@UNKNOWN@@ year on the supreme court today the occasion will differ sharply from previous @@UNKNOWN@@ of his tenure 
 for the first time the @@UNKNOWN@@ justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court 's majority 
 this role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies justices @@UNKNOWN@@ marshall harry @@UNKNOWN@@ and john stevens 
 but are these four players three of them in their @@UNKNOWN@@ ready to assume a different role after N years @@UNKNOWN@@ of service on the high court 
 every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the @@UNKNOWN@@ that go with it but in different ways 
 justices @@UNKNOWN@@ and stevens appear @@UNKNOWN@@ about it justices marshall and @@UNKNOWN@@ appear fighting mad 
 the four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to @@UNKNOWN@@ the court 's conservative @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 but always in years past they have @@UNKNOWN@@ the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to @@UNKNOWN@@ out a number of major victories in civil rights and @@UNKNOWN@@ cases

 he has said that he now knows how justice john @@UNKNOWN@@ felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent @@UNKNOWN@@ from the warren court 's opinions 
 associates of @@UNKNOWN@@ justice marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is @@UNKNOWN@@ about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights 
 we could sweep it under the @@UNKNOWN@@ and hide it but i 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month 
 he like justice @@UNKNOWN@@ considers @@UNKNOWN@@ highly important for the future a point that has n't escaped legal scholars

 the @@UNKNOWN@@ in the warren court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ and marshall are speaking in their @@UNKNOWN@@ to a more distant future he says 
 justice @@UNKNOWN@@ who will turn N next month also seems @@UNKNOWN@@ about his new role 
 associates say he takes some @@UNKNOWN@@ more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his N opinion roe vs. wade 
 friends and associates who saw justice @@UNKNOWN@@ during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years 
 and his outlook improved after successful @@UNKNOWN@@ surgery in august

 the government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thrifts but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth 
 the four s&ls were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the N previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago 
 two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp. charlotte n.c. which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in texas and florida

 time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise @@UNKNOWN@@

 however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N N higher per subscriber according to richard @@UNKNOWN@@ time associate publisher 
 time is following the course of some other @@UNKNOWN@@ magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing @@UNKNOWN@@ that maintaining artificially high and expensive @@UNKNOWN@@ is the way to draw advertisers 
 in recent years reader 's digest new york times co. 's mccall 's and most recently news corp. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers 
 deep discounts in @@UNKNOWN@@ and offers of free @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the @@UNKNOWN@@ world of magazine @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 but time as part of the more @@UNKNOWN@@ time warner wants to @@UNKNOWN@@ itself away from expensive @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a @@UNKNOWN@@ radio is @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ just give people the wrong image said mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 that perception takes the focus off the magazine 
 time magazine executives predictably @@UNKNOWN@@ the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers 
 what we are doing is @@UNKNOWN@@ out the readers who are only @@UNKNOWN@@ related to the magazine and do n't really read it said mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 we are trying to create quality and involvement 
 however time executives used the same explanation when in october N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million

 it 's @@UNKNOWN@@ for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more said michael @@UNKNOWN@@ national media director at bozell inc. ad agency 
 a few drops in circulation are of no consequence 
 it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while @@UNKNOWN@@ their profits 
 mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away

 september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge friday 
 after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N N last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer 
 although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline 
 analysts immediately viewed the price data the @@UNKNOWN@@ inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped 
 further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N N in september to $ N billion 
 that rise came on top of a N N gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy 
 i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said robert @@UNKNOWN@@ chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago 
 but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers 
 the overall N N increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N N said gordon @@UNKNOWN@@ an economist at the national association of manufacturers 
 but sung won @@UNKNOWN@@ chief economist at @@UNKNOWN@@ corp. in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump

 inflation @@UNKNOWN@@ has fallen back from its @@UNKNOWN@@ pace last winter when a steep @@UNKNOWN@@ in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates 
 energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months 
 overall the index has climbed at a N N compound annual rate since the start of the year the labor department said 
 while far more @@UNKNOWN@@ than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a @@UNKNOWN@@ rise than the N N increase for all of N 
 moreover this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices @@UNKNOWN@@ up N N after plunging N N in august 
 some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain 
 analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N N climb was higher than most anticipated 
 i think the @@UNKNOWN@@ in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john @@UNKNOWN@@ chief economist at bell @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ a washington economic forecasting firm 
 he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide 
 but @@UNKNOWN@@ van @@UNKNOWN@@ president of the national association of @@UNKNOWN@@ said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an @@UNKNOWN@@ as the N N figure suggests 
 if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained 
 passenger car prices jumped N N in september after climbing N N in august and declining in the late spring and summer 
 many analysts said the september increase was a one-time event coming as dealers introduced their N models 
 although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the @@UNKNOWN@@ autumn increase 
 prices for capital equipment rose a hefty N N in september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N N 
 food prices declined N N after climbing N N in august 
 meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N N in september to $ N billion 
 but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said 
 sales at general merchandise stores rose N N after declining N N in august while sales of building materials fell N N after rising N N 
 producer prices for intermediate goods grew N N in september after dropping for three consecutive months

 centrust savings bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened 
 in a statement miami-based centrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends 
 regulators also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred stock 
 david l. paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thrift supervision which issued the @@UNKNOWN@@ saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons 
 he said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision 
 the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health 
 in march regulators labeled centrust a troubled institution largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses 
 in the same month the office of thrift supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track 
 for the nine months ended june N centrust had a net loss of $ N million compared with year-earlier net income of $ N million 
 centrust which is florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation 
 since april it has @@UNKNOWN@@ its high-yield bond holdings to about $ N million from $ N billion 
 mr. paul said only about $ N million of the current holdings are @@UNKNOWN@@ securities registered with the securities and exchange commission 
 the remainder he said are commercial loan @@UNKNOWN@@ or private @@UNKNOWN@@ that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market 
 centrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market @@UNKNOWN@@ for the junk bonds 
 the office of thrift supervision has been @@UNKNOWN@@ centrust to provide current market values for its holdings but centrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative @@UNKNOWN@@ of the bonds and lack of a ready market 
 regulators have become increasingly @@UNKNOWN@@ about centrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market 
 the legislation requires thrifts to @@UNKNOWN@@ themselves of junk bonds in the new @@UNKNOWN@@ regulatory climate 
 in american stock exchange composite trading friday centrust common shares closed at $ N down N cents 
 in a statement friday mr. paul challenged the regulators ' decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank 
 he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds 
 in the third quarter for instance centrust added $ N million to its general reserves 
 mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with @@UNKNOWN@@ centrust 's request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp. based in beverly hills calif 
 the branch sale is the centerpiece of centrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a @@UNKNOWN@@ institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr. paul 
 most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now 
 many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal 
 branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution 
 centrust however @@UNKNOWN@@ the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ N million or about N N of assets from a negative $ N million as of sept. N thus bringing centrust close to regulatory standards 
 centrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million 
 critics however say the branch sale will make centrust more dependent than ever on @@UNKNOWN@@ deposits and junk bonds

 not only is mr. mason the star of chicken soup he 's also the @@UNKNOWN@@ of a @@UNKNOWN@@ tradition dating back to duck soup and he 's currently a man in hot water 
 here in neutral language is the @@UNKNOWN@@ of mr. mason 's remarks quoted first in the village voice while he was a paid spokesman for the rudolph giuliani mayoral campaign and then in newsweek after he and the campaign @@UNKNOWN@@ company 
 mr. mason said that many jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks so they support black candidates @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 he said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination so they too support black candidates @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 he said that @@UNKNOWN@@ have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 of course mr. mason did not use neutral language 
 as a @@UNKNOWN@@ of ethnic humor from the old days on the @@UNKNOWN@@ belt live television and the @@UNKNOWN@@ circuit mr. mason @@UNKNOWN@@ reached for the @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 he said @@UNKNOWN@@ were sick with @@UNKNOWN@@ and he called david dinkins mr. giuliani 's black opponent a fancy @@UNKNOWN@@ with a @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 if mr. mason had used less @@UNKNOWN@@ language to @@UNKNOWN@@ his @@UNKNOWN@@ analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow new @@UNKNOWN@@ would the water be quite so hot 
 it probably would because few or none of the people upset by mr. mason 's remarks have bothered to @@UNKNOWN@@ between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used @@UNKNOWN@@ language 
 in addition some of mr. mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 for example the new york state counsel for the @@UNKNOWN@@ said that mr. mason is like a @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck 
 these critics fail to @@UNKNOWN@@ between the type of ethnic humor that aims at @@UNKNOWN@@ another group such as polish jokes and the type that is @@UNKNOWN@@ aiming @@UNKNOWN@@ as well as @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the latter typically is the humor of the @@UNKNOWN@@ and it was @@UNKNOWN@@ by both blacks and @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ stage as a means of @@UNKNOWN@@ their white and @@UNKNOWN@@ audiences along with themselves 
 in the hands of a @@UNKNOWN@@ like @@UNKNOWN@@ bruce this @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ could cut both the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the audience to @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 but @@UNKNOWN@@ by a pro like @@UNKNOWN@@ mason it is a @@UNKNOWN@@ form of @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 why @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 because despite all the media @@UNKNOWN@@ about comedy and politics not @@UNKNOWN@@ they are similar in one respect both can serve as @@UNKNOWN@@ for easing @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ of groups in conflict 
 that 's why it 's dangerous to have @@UNKNOWN@@ thought police on college @@UNKNOWN@@ and elsewhere @@UNKNOWN@@ all critical mention of group differences 
 as elizabeth @@UNKNOWN@@ wrote in the new york times just before the mason @@UNKNOWN@@ perhaps @@UNKNOWN@@ would not @@UNKNOWN@@ over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the question is if group conflicts still exist as @@UNKNOWN@@ they do and if mr. mason 's type of ethnic humor is @@UNKNOWN@@ then what other means do we have for letting off steam 
 do n't say the tv @@UNKNOWN@@ because that happens to be a @@UNKNOWN@@ that in its desperate need to attract everybody and @@UNKNOWN@@ nobody resembles politics more than it does comedy 
 it is true that the best @@UNKNOWN@@ do allow group differences to @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ vs. blue-collar @@UNKNOWN@@ in @@UNKNOWN@@ children vs. adults in the cosby show

 at least they both speak with strong @@UNKNOWN@@ as do @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 it could n't be more obvious that chicken soup is being made from an old @@UNKNOWN@@

 clearly the question with chicken soup is not whether the pot will @@UNKNOWN@@ over but whether it will @@UNKNOWN@@ at all 
 so far the @@UNKNOWN@@ have been few and far between 
 part of the problem is the tendency of all @@UNKNOWN@@ ever since the @@UNKNOWN@@ days of norman @@UNKNOWN@@ to @@UNKNOWN@@ about social issues 
 to some extent this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to @@UNKNOWN@@ us about ethnic @@UNKNOWN@@ by @@UNKNOWN@@ them 
 for instance michael @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ not because he 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ jewish businessman but because he @@UNKNOWN@@ his @@UNKNOWN@@ job as a salesman in order to become a social worker 
 even more @@UNKNOWN@@ is the @@UNKNOWN@@ between @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and mr. mason 's comic @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end and occasionally in the middle when mr. mason @@UNKNOWN@@ into his @@UNKNOWN@@ mode and starts @@UNKNOWN@@ out that old-fashioned jewish @@UNKNOWN@@ to other people as well as to himself

 the senate 's decision to approve a @@UNKNOWN@@ deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of @@UNKNOWN@@ a gains tax reduction this year 
 late friday night the senate voted N to approve an estimated $ N billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened rather than narrowed the federal budget deficit

 we 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill said senate budget committee chairman james @@UNKNOWN@@ d. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 but senate supporters of the @@UNKNOWN@@ legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside including a capital-gains tax cut 
 in addition the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the house includes a capital-gains provision

 no one can predict exactly what will happen on the house side said senate minority leader robert dole r. @@UNKNOWN@@

 white house budget director richard darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill 
 we do n't need this as a way to get capital gains he said 
 house budget committee chairman leon @@UNKNOWN@@ d. calif said in an interview if that 's the signal that comes from the white house that will help a great deal 
 the senate 's decision was a setback for president bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year

 one obvious place to @@UNKNOWN@@ a capital-gains tax cut and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit 
 such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month 
 the senate bill was @@UNKNOWN@@ back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through congress 
 because the legislation has n't been completed president bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law 
 senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the house to agree to the @@UNKNOWN@@ bill

 a key is whether house republicans are willing to @@UNKNOWN@@ to their senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions 
 although i am encouraged by the senate action said chairman dan @@UNKNOWN@@ d. ill of the house ways and means committee it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the @@UNKNOWN@@ conference with the senate 
 another big question @@UNKNOWN@@ over the debate is what president bush thinks 
 he has been @@UNKNOWN@@ a @@UNKNOWN@@ bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut 
 but republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and @@UNKNOWN@@ the N votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor so they went ahead with the @@UNKNOWN@@ bill 
 the senate bill was stripped of many popular though @@UNKNOWN@@ provisions a number of which are included in the house-passed bill 
 these include a child-care initiative and @@UNKNOWN@@ of @@UNKNOWN@@ tax breaks for low-income housing and @@UNKNOWN@@ expenditures 
 also missing from the senate bill is the house 's repeal of a law called section N that @@UNKNOWN@@ companies to give @@UNKNOWN@@ workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives

 in addition the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a N N @@UNKNOWN@@ tax on long-distance telephone calls 
 it no longer includes a plan that would have @@UNKNOWN@@ what remains of the @@UNKNOWN@@ method of accounting which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden

 there was a unique combination in N he says

 it defended appropriate constitutional @@UNKNOWN@@ and practical common sense 
 the problem which the journal so @@UNKNOWN@@ pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a @@UNKNOWN@@ body

 i disagree with the statement by mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ that one should not draw an adverse @@UNKNOWN@@ against former hud officials who @@UNKNOWN@@ their fifth amendment privilege against @@UNKNOWN@@ in congressional hearings 
 the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be @@UNKNOWN@@ in any criminal case to be a witness against himself 
 this privilege against @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ the drawing of an adverse @@UNKNOWN@@ against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify 
 thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be @@UNKNOWN@@ to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth 
 the privilege however has been limited in @@UNKNOWN@@ with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only 
 the supreme court and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the @@UNKNOWN@@ where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ v. @@UNKNOWN@@ N u.s. N N 
 thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse @@UNKNOWN@@ against him in the civil matter 
 he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and @@UNKNOWN@@ belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution 
 allowing the defendant to take the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony @@UNKNOWN@@ him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be @@UNKNOWN@@ used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ the risk of such prosecution a court may order the defendant to testify 
 thus when mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ asserted the fifth in a @@UNKNOWN@@ proceeding particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution 
 the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse @@UNKNOWN@@ and to @@UNKNOWN@@ with mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ 's own belief that his testimony could help @@UNKNOWN@@ him of a crime

 the N crash brought the reagan administration and democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ N billion even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ N billion during that period 
 but barring further drops in the market this week a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year 
 lawmakers and administration officials agree that friday 's drop by itself is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's @@UNKNOWN@@ plan which still is n't fully implemented 
 one of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that as everyone learned in N the economy and the market can survive a one-day @@UNKNOWN@@ tumble 
 everybody thought we were looking at a @@UNKNOWN@@ of N that we were looking at a recession rep. @@UNKNOWN@@ said yesterday in an interview 
 that did not happen 
 they learned they could survive it without much problem 
 but administration officials privately agree with mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ who said a @@UNKNOWN@@ drop this week is going to force the president and congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy 
 in that case there will be plenty of blame to go around 
 there is an underlying concern on the part of the american people and there should be that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut said senate finance committee chairman lloyd @@UNKNOWN@@ d. texas 
 nevertheless it clearly will take more than friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and white house budget director richard darman over the capital-gains fight 
 hill democrats are particularly angry over mr. bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of april 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation 
 there is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on cbs news 's face the nation 
 during last week 's @@UNKNOWN@@ on the @@UNKNOWN@@ bill and the capital-gains issue there were signs that senate republicans and the administration were at odds 
 at the very moment that senate republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it 
 when an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member of the @@UNKNOWN@@ senate finance committee hailed it 
 asked if the administration agreed he @@UNKNOWN@@ replied the @@UNKNOWN@@ will have to speak for itself 
 friday 's market tumble could spur action on @@UNKNOWN@@ the house and senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 senate republicans expressed the hope that the house would follow the lead of the senate which on friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal N deficit 
 the market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction and the best way to do that is for the house of representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions sen. warren @@UNKNOWN@@ r. @@UNKNOWN@@ said yesterday 
 the white house office of management and budget whose calculations determine whether the gramm-rudman targets are met estimated that the house-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal N @@UNKNOWN@@ by $ N billion almost half of the congressional budget office 's estimate of $ N billion 
 rep. @@UNKNOWN@@ said that @@UNKNOWN@@ 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts but added we 're getting very close to the margins here 
 no one in washington was willing to take the blame for @@UNKNOWN@@ friday 's drop in the stock market 
 but some players were quick to seize the moment 
 before the sun had set on friday richard @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ chief economist of the u.s. chamber of commerce issued a statement @@UNKNOWN@@ the drop in stock prices to the senate decision to postpone action on capital gains 
 investors who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell were spooked he said 
 there have been many @@UNKNOWN@@ reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut sen. mitchell said during his television appearance but i suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others

 thursday 's report on the september consumer price index is expected to rise although not as sharply as the N N gain reported friday in the producer price index 
 that gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in friday 's session before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge 
 economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in september reports on industrial production and capacity utilization also due tomorrow

 trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow he said

 so do those who seek a @@UNKNOWN@@ concept of @@UNKNOWN@@ a concept imposing stern obligations as well as @@UNKNOWN@@ rights 
 then there are @@UNKNOWN@@ opponents 
 to @@UNKNOWN@@ mandatory service is an @@UNKNOWN@@ and voluntary systems are @@UNKNOWN@@ uses of tax money 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ of the market question the value of the work national service would perform 
 if the market wo n't pay for it they argue it ca n't be worth its cost 
 elements of the left are also @@UNKNOWN@@ opposed they see service as a cover for the draft or fear the @@UNKNOWN@@ of youth or want to see rights @@UNKNOWN@@ not obligations 
 but what about those of us whose views are not @@UNKNOWN@@ by formula or @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 how should we think about national service 
 let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion national service has no agreed meaning 
 would service be voluntary or @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 short or long 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ or full-time 
 paid or unpaid 
 would participants live at home and work nearby or live in @@UNKNOWN@@ and work on public @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 what kinds of work would they do 
 what does national mean 
 would the program be run by the federal government by local governments or by private voluntary organizations 
 and who would serve 
 only males as with the draft or both @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 youth only or all ages 
 middle-class people or poor people or a genuine @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 many or few 
 those are not @@UNKNOWN@@ questions and the label national service answers none of them 
 then how should we think about national service 
 as a starting point here are five @@UNKNOWN@@ N consider the @@UNKNOWN@@ not the name 
 ignore national service in the @@UNKNOWN@@ consider specific proposals 
 they will differ in crucial ways 
 N service should be service 
 as commonly understood service implies sacrifice 
 it involves accepting risk or giving up income or deferring a career 
 it follows that proposals like @@UNKNOWN@@ whose benefits to @@UNKNOWN@@ are worth some $ N a year do not qualify 
 there is a rationale for such bills federal subsidies to college students amount to a @@UNKNOWN@@ bill without the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ those benefits should be earned not given 
 but the earnings exceed by N N the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs 
 why call that service 
 N encouragement is fine @@UNKNOWN@@ is not 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ service is unconstitutional 
 it is also @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 who will throw several hundred thousand @@UNKNOWN@@ in jail each year 
 but through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior 
 it should also encourage service @@UNKNOWN@@ by all classes and all ages 
 its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of @@UNKNOWN@@ in the u.s. should build on the service programs already in existence and should honor local convictions about which tasks most need doing 
 N good programs are not cheap 
 enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done @@UNKNOWN@@ forest fires fought housing @@UNKNOWN@@ students @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ centers @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 there is important work to be done and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even @@UNKNOWN@@ who start with few skills can do much of it well but not @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 good service programs require @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ training and supervision all of high quality 
 they involve @@UNKNOWN@@ to participants 
 full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision they are particularly expensive more per participant than a year at stanford or yale 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ programs are cheaper but good ones still come to some $ N a year 
 are they worth that 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ suggest that good ones are especially so if the effects on participants are counted 
 but the calculations are @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 N @@UNKNOWN@@ youth are a special concern 
 are such expenditures @@UNKNOWN@@ then 
 yes if targeted 
 people of all ages and all classes should be encouraged to serve but there are many ways for middle-class kids and their elders to serve at little public cost 
 they can volunteer at any of thousands of @@UNKNOWN@@ institutions or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ youth do n't have those opportunities 
 they are not @@UNKNOWN@@ in high school or college 
 they are unlikely to be employed 
 and they have grown up in @@UNKNOWN@@ grim circumstances among family structures breaking down surrounded by @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and bleak prospects 
 but many of them can be quite @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ by productive and disciplined service 
 some wo n't accept the discipline others drop out for other reasons 
 but some whom nothing else is reaching are transformed 
 learning skills producing something @@UNKNOWN@@ feeling useful they are no longer dependent others now depend on them 
 even if it is cheaper to build @@UNKNOWN@@ or @@UNKNOWN@@ apartments or plant @@UNKNOWN@@ with paid professionals the effects on the young people providing those services alter the @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 strictly speaking these youth are not performing service 
 they are giving up no income deferring no careers @@UNKNOWN@@ no risk 
 but they believe themselves to be serving and they begin to respect themselves and others to take control of their lives to think of the future 
 that is a service to the nation

 in addition officials at the fed and in the bush administration decided that avoiding @@UNKNOWN@@ actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout 
 the disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis said one government official insisting on @@UNKNOWN@@

 the economy remains @@UNKNOWN@@ and the outlook is for continued moderate growth 
 but administration officials conceded that friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week 
 one possibility is that this is a surgical setback reasonably limited in its @@UNKNOWN@@ and not a major problem said one senior administration official who also asked that he not be named

 nevertheless fed chairman greenspan and vice chairman manuel johnson were in their offices sunday evening monitoring events as they @@UNKNOWN@@ in markets around the world 
 the action was expected to begin with the opening of the new zealand foreign exchange markets at N p.m. est when stocks there plunged and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in tokyo and through early this morning in europe

 the three men worked together on the so-called brady commission headed by mr. brady which was established after the N crash to examine the market 's collapse

 no one can say for sure what will happen today

 investors who sold everything after the crash of N lived to regret it

 panic selling also was @@UNKNOWN@@ during other big declines in the past 
 the crash of N was followed by a substantial recovery before the great depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began

 there has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash says stephen b. @@UNKNOWN@@ chief investment officer of chicago-based kemper financial services inc

 friday 's action was an old-fashioned panic says alfred goldman director of technical market analysis for a.g. edwards & sons in st. louis 
 stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price

 james craig portfolio manager for the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ fund which has one of the industry 's better track records started his buying during friday 's plunge 
 stocks such as @@UNKNOWN@@ foods corp. @@UNKNOWN@@ stores inc. american international group inc. and federal national mortgage association became such bargains that he could n't resist them he says 
 and mr. craig expects to pick up more shares today 
 it will be chaotic at first but i would not be buying if i thought we were headed for real trouble he says 
 he argues that stocks are reasonably valued now and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of N 
 mr. front of stein roe suggests that any buying should concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side or stocks that have been beaten down a lot more than the market in this correction

 david m. jones vice president at @@UNKNOWN@@ g. @@UNKNOWN@@ & co. recommends treasury securities of up to five years ' maturity 
 he says the oct. N employment report showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector is a warning sign to investors 
 one strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their bets is to buy put options either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index 
 a put option gives its holder the right but not the obligation to sell a stock or stock index for a specified price the strike price until the option expires 
 whether this insurance is @@UNKNOWN@@ depends on the cost of an option 
 the cost or premium tends to get fat in times of crisis 
 thus buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk 
 the prices of puts generally did n't soar friday

 like many others mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ took notice in N when sony in a classic example of market @@UNKNOWN@@ changed the plastic skin and @@UNKNOWN@@ on the famous @@UNKNOWN@@ line of portable audio equipment and created the my first sony line for children 
 the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ new products looked more like toys than the adult models 
 in court papers sony says it has spent more than $ N million to promote the line with resulting sales of over a million units 
 sony found a new market niche but mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ figured that its prices left plenty of room for a @@UNKNOWN@@ competitor 
 his products are n't exact copies of sony 's but strongly resemble them in size shape and especially color 
 sony uses mostly red and blue with @@UNKNOWN@@ of yellow and so does justin on the theory that kids prefer these colors

 recalls mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone 
 we never intended taking on sony we do n't have the resources

 trading ground to a halt as investors rushed to sell bonds only to find themselves @@UNKNOWN@@ by potential buyers 
 stunned they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades 
 the junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now there are no bids only offers says independent investor martin d. @@UNKNOWN@@ who manages nearly $ N billion and who recently decided to buy @@UNKNOWN@@ securities for a new fund 
 this @@UNKNOWN@@ is far from over he says 
 junk 's collapse helped @@UNKNOWN@@ the @@UNKNOWN@@ selling of stocks that produced the @@UNKNOWN@@ one-day dive in the dow jones industrial average since the oct. N N crash

 the shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with junk financing

 now dozens of corporations including @@UNKNOWN@@ allen tw services and york international that are counting on at least $ N billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs afloat may never get the money

 you 've either got a chair or you do n't 
 in friday 's aftermath says r. douglas @@UNKNOWN@@ a director of high-yield finance at first boston corp. much of the $ N billion forward calendar could be deferred depending on the @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 in august first boston withdrew a $ N million junk offering of ohio @@UNKNOWN@@ bonds because potential buyers were very @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the outlook looks shaky because we 're still waiting for mutual funds in particular to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off redemptions by individual investors says king @@UNKNOWN@@ senior vice president at @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ & @@UNKNOWN@@ an investment arm of xerox financial services 
 indeed a moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of N high-yield mutual funds declined for the @@UNKNOWN@@ consecutive day friday 
 in a stark contrast the benchmark 30-year treasury bond climbed more than N N points or about $ N for each $ N face amount to N N its biggest gain of the year 
 the bond 's yield dropped to N N the lowest since march N N according to technical data global markets group 
 the yield on three-month treasury bills considered the @@UNKNOWN@@ of all investments plummeted about N percentage point to N N the largest one-day decline since N 
 the main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
 when you get panic in one market you get flight to quality in the other said maria ramirez money market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 nevertheless the problems of the junk market could prompt the federal reserve to ease credit in the months ahead 
 this marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook says william sullivan director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc. new york 
 any sustained @@UNKNOWN@@ could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities 
 robert dow a partner and portfolio manager at lord @@UNKNOWN@@ & co. which manages $ N billion of high-yield bonds says he does n't think there is any fundamental economic rationale for the junk bond rout

 i do n't believe that 's the case but i believe that people are running scared 
 there is a flight to quality and the quality is not in equities and not in junk it 's in treasurys 
 even as trading in high-yield issues @@UNKNOWN@@ up over the past month corporations sold more than $ N billion of new junk bonds 
 for example a recent $ N million offering of @@UNKNOWN@@ gas services l.p. bonds sold by first boston was three times oversubscribed 
 a $ N million offering of turner broadcasting system inc high-yield securities sold last week by drexel was increased $ N million because of strong demand 
 first boston estimates that in november and december alone junk bond investors will receive $ N billion of coupon interest payments 
 that 's a clear indication that there is and will be an @@UNKNOWN@@ of basic business going on says mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ of first boston 
 i do n't know how people can say the junk bond market disappeared when there were $ N billion of orders for $ N million of junk bonds sold last week by turner says raymond @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of merchant banking at merrill lynch & co 
 when the rally comes insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will 
 there is plenty of money available from people who want to buy @@UNKNOWN@@ deals it 's the stuff that 's financed on a @@UNKNOWN@@ that people are wary of 
 but such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have @@UNKNOWN@@ this year casting a pall over much of the junk market 
 michael @@UNKNOWN@@ director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services says the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer contributing to the slide in prices 
 last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals he says 
 this year at best it 's in one in every five or six 
 and our credit standards have n't changed one @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 however mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ said the slide in junk is creating one hell of a buying opportunity for selective buyers 
 for the moment investors seem more @@UNKNOWN@@ with the bad junk than the good junk 
 the market has been weak since the announcement of the campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by olympia & york says mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ of merrill lynch 
 that really affected the market in that people started to ask what else is in trouble 
 well before campeau though there were signs that the junk market was @@UNKNOWN@@ through one of its worst years ever 
 despite the relatively strong economy junk bond prices did nothing except go down @@UNKNOWN@@ by a seemingly endless trail of bad news 
 in june two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ N billion of speculative debt securities new york-based integrated resources inc. said it ran out of borrowed money 
 in july southmark corp. the dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ N billion of junk bonds voluntarily filed for protection under u.s. bankruptcy law 
 by the end of july the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year treasury notes widened to more than N percentage points 
 in august resorts international inc. which sold more than $ N million of junk bonds suspended interest payments 
 in september just as the cash squeeze hit campeau @@UNKNOWN@@ financial corp. defaulted on $ N million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ N billion of debt securities 
 meantime regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 moody 's says the frequency of corporate credit @@UNKNOWN@@ is the highest this year since N 
 in addition there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of N according to the federal deposit insurance corp 
 the era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate @@UNKNOWN@@ an early critic of the junk bond market 
 what we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying @@UNKNOWN@@ compound interest

 what we 're seeing now is the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ of asset values to a future when @@UNKNOWN@@ debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy

 of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease 
 to take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment however the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms 
 it must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective 
 specifically it must understand how real-estate markets @@UNKNOWN@@ to shifts in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities 
 when a regional economy @@UNKNOWN@@ cold the local real-estate market gets @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 in other words real-estate market indicators such as building permits and leasing activity plummet much further than a local economy in recession 
 this was seen in the late 1960s in los angeles and the mid-1970s in new york

 why do local real-estate markets @@UNKNOWN@@ to regional economic cycles 
 because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth 
 metropolitan detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment 
 area employment dropped by N N from its N peak and retail sales were down N N 
 however the real-estate market was hurt even more 
 for example residential building permits in the trough year of N were off N N from the N peak level 
 once metropolitan detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s real estate rebounded 
 building permits for example soared a staggering N N between N and the peak year of N 
 where @@UNKNOWN@@ corporations and professional firms are now asking are today 's opportunities 
 look no further than metropolitan houston and denver two of the most depressed overbuilt and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation 
 of course some observers have touted houston and denver for the past five years as a @@UNKNOWN@@ play 
 but now appears to be the time to act 
 metropolitan houston 's economy did drop and then @@UNKNOWN@@ in the years after its N peak 
 in the mid-1980s employment was down as much as N N from the N peak and retail sales were off N N 
 the real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks

 metropolitan houston 's population has held steady over the past six years

 today metropolitan houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround 
 more than N jobs were added in @@UNKNOWN@@ houston last year primarily in biotechnology petrochemical processing and the computer industry 
 this growth puts houston in the top five @@UNKNOWN@@ areas in the nation last year

 its population has continued to increase since N the peak year of the economic cycle 
 employment is now N N higher than in N 
 buying income in real dollars actually increased N N between N and N the most recent year available 
 the rates of increase however are less than the rapid growth of the boom years and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy

 as other @@UNKNOWN@@ governments particularly poland and the soviet union have recently discovered initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult if not impossible to control 
 as the days go by the south african government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued @@UNKNOWN@@ of mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ as well as the continued banning of the anc and enforcement of the state of emergency 
 if it does n't yield on these matters and eventually begin talking directly to the anc the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to @@UNKNOWN@@ and unrest 
 if it does the large number of @@UNKNOWN@@ whites who oppose any concessions to the black majority will step up their @@UNKNOWN@@ and threats to take matters into their own hands 
 the newly released anc leaders also will be under enormous pressure 
 the government is watching closely to see if their presence in the @@UNKNOWN@@ leads to increased @@UNKNOWN@@ protests and violence if it does pretoria will use this as a reason to keep mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ behind bars 
 pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life @@UNKNOWN@@ in the first place for sabotage and conspiracy to @@UNKNOWN@@ the government 
 in addition the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the anc and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 in order to head off any divisions mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released instructed them to report to the anc headquarters in @@UNKNOWN@@ as soon as possible 
 the men also will be faced with @@UNKNOWN@@ the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many @@UNKNOWN@@ black @@UNKNOWN@@ the so-called young @@UNKNOWN@@ who are anxious to see the old @@UNKNOWN@@ in action 
 says peter @@UNKNOWN@@ president of the south african youth congress we will be expecting them to act like leaders of the anc 
 they never considered themselves to be anything else 
 at last night 's rally they called on their @@UNKNOWN@@ to be firm yet disciplined in their opposition to apartheid 
 we @@UNKNOWN@@ discipline because we know that the government is very very sensitive said andrew @@UNKNOWN@@ another early @@UNKNOWN@@ leader who is now N 
 we want to see nelson @@UNKNOWN@@ and all our @@UNKNOWN@@ out of prison and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us
