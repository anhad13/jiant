 robert j. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 national geographic the @@UNKNOWN@@ u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy @@UNKNOWN@@ pages that upscale advertisers love 
 so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half 
 to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times 
 despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to @@UNKNOWN@@ through in search of @@UNKNOWN@@ tribe women 
 worse it lagged behind competitors in offering @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers 
 but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign 
 advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan @@UNKNOWN@@ who joined in april as national advertising director 
 what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance 
 people did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't 
 the @@UNKNOWN@@ magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much @@UNKNOWN@@ before 
 it largely @@UNKNOWN@@ on its @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the @@UNKNOWN@@ of their @@UNKNOWN@@ years loyalty to the tune of an N N average subscription renewal rate 
 the magazine had its best year yet in N when it @@UNKNOWN@@ its centennial and racked up a N N gain in ad pages to N 
 but this year when the @@UNKNOWN@@ surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest 
 the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some @@UNKNOWN@@ that make it especially @@UNKNOWN@@ during a soft market 
 perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a @@UNKNOWN@@ page vs. $ N for the @@UNKNOWN@@ a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation 
 when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major @@UNKNOWN@@ for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all 
 even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like @@UNKNOWN@@ the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc 
 to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets 
 but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors 
 time magazine for example has more than N separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups 
 another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of @@UNKNOWN@@ its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do

 the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to @@UNKNOWN@@ exchange officials and traders 
 the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice 
 dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers 
 the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange 
 while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations 
 critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders 
 traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders 
 the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand 
 the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for @@UNKNOWN@@ traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration 
 the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions 
 the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them 
 wendy @@UNKNOWN@@ the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said 
 whether a trade is done on a dual or @@UNKNOWN@@ basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact 
 currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the tests indicate that dual and @@UNKNOWN@@ traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. @@UNKNOWN@@ told the senate panel 
 members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to @@UNKNOWN@@ cftc operations 
 the house 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of N contracts or more @@UNKNOWN@@ those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system 
 the senate bill would force the cftc to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect @@UNKNOWN@@ abuses 
 so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well 
 the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in N 
 under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers 
 traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves 
 a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit 
 it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said 
 he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal 
 but at a meeting last week tom @@UNKNOWN@@ the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving

 we keep a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ to him around the pentagon @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and such 
 the army headquarters on the third deck of the pentagon used to @@UNKNOWN@@ a lot of @@UNKNOWN@@ to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it 
 you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the @@UNKNOWN@@ he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james @@UNKNOWN@@ blocked him 
 now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done 
 to keep him quiet we @@UNKNOWN@@ a new unified command every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and @@UNKNOWN@@ under it 
 but we still hear him @@UNKNOWN@@ at night because the navy has a few ships left and to satisfy him the navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new air force bureaucracy in illinois its space operations to another command in colorado the @@UNKNOWN@@ to a new army bureaucracy in fort @@UNKNOWN@@ and the navy 's indian ocean and persian gulf forces to an army bureaucracy in florida 
 which brings up the worst and @@UNKNOWN@@ ghost of all the ghost of the shah of iran 
 when the shah died president carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for @@UNKNOWN@@ him out to make way for the @@UNKNOWN@@ that he declared the carter doctrine 
 mr. carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran 
 but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots 
 so mr. carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid @@UNKNOWN@@ force 
 but that ghost was n't @@UNKNOWN@@ he knew the @@UNKNOWN@@ was neither rapid nor @@UNKNOWN@@ nor a force even though it cost $ N billion or $ N billion a year 
 after mr. carter was defeated in N the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 i saw what he did to them @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 it made my @@UNKNOWN@@ dance with @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd leap from behind some @@UNKNOWN@@ of marshall onto cap 's @@UNKNOWN@@ and grab him by the @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ him till he @@UNKNOWN@@ up an additional $ N billion or so 
 cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the @@UNKNOWN@@ and the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ and a thousand tactical aircraft to the air force 
 he bought $ N billion in @@UNKNOWN@@ ships and $ N billion in @@UNKNOWN@@ and equipment to fill them and @@UNKNOWN@@ them at a new $ N billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean 
 he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf 
 one night both marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground 
 before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the @@UNKNOWN@@ in tampa and renamed it central command 
 he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean 
 marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole navy 
 they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 but the shah still kept leaping out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ N billion of @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ etc. in order that those seven new army divisions and three marine @@UNKNOWN@@ could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 then suddenly @@UNKNOWN@@ 's ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in asia N miles away 
 we 'd get our @@UNKNOWN@@ kicked 
 lucky for cap @@UNKNOWN@@ was @@UNKNOWN@@ and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back 
 so the u.s. found itself paying about $ N billion in @@UNKNOWN@@ to various arab @@UNKNOWN@@ for @@UNKNOWN@@ rights around the indian ocean 
 we had great success in somalia 
 but then it turned out that president @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ was not at all a nice person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in @@UNKNOWN@@ had @@UNKNOWN@@ up about a hundred years ago and anyway was N miles from the mouth of the gulf 
 but who 's counting 
 still @@UNKNOWN@@ was the best we could get so we stay in bed with president @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 all these reports about him committing @@UNKNOWN@@ are probably @@UNKNOWN@@ anyway 
 but would n't you know now that we are spending @@UNKNOWN@@ of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in iran the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject 
 meanwhile congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget 
 predictably some navy guys said do we still need to keep all N army divisions on active duty and all those extra @@UNKNOWN@@ aircraft without bases and all those army guys playing @@UNKNOWN@@ in tampa 
 could n't we save $ N billion or $ N billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves 
 and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by @@UNKNOWN@@ central command and putting responsibility for gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force @@UNKNOWN@@ in the gulf 
 and where were all our @@UNKNOWN@@ paid indian ocean allies last year when our @@UNKNOWN@@ were being attacked 
 questions like that really stir up marshall 's ghost 
 he appeared late one night in the @@UNKNOWN@@ of the new defense secretary dick cheney 
 marshall came @@UNKNOWN@@ in like @@UNKNOWN@@ 's ghost dragging those chains of @@UNKNOWN@@ and air wings and links with arab @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 he would n't leave until mr. cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him

 then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the f-14 and the @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 on the other hand mr. cheney retained all those new land forces 
 marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back 
 what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more pentagon bureaucrats are @@UNKNOWN@@ under their desks 
 they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships

 the @@UNKNOWN@@ is that the $ N million was @@UNKNOWN@@ from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special @@UNKNOWN@@ which he did not do 
 besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on la @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ off miami beach

 trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key 
 when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by centrust 
 he established his reputation as a @@UNKNOWN@@ in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the linda and gerald guterman collection in new york 
 there on one of his first shopping trips mr. paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices 
 he paid $ N million for instance for a still life by jan @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ that was expected to fetch perhaps $ N 
 the price paid was a record for the artist 
 some N N of items offered at the guterman auction were sold at an average price of $ N

 afterward mr. paul is said by mr. guterman to have @@UNKNOWN@@ mr. guterman the new york developer selling the collection and @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 he says he @@UNKNOWN@@ them recalls mr. guterman 
 and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida 
 mr. paul denies @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 it 's just not true he says 
 mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george wachter a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items 
 mr. wachter who became his principal adviser searched @@UNKNOWN@@ in london paris and @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 and according to one dealer mr. wachter had a @@UNKNOWN@@ for introducing mr. paul with the phrase he can buy anything

 mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money

 mr. paul was eager to @@UNKNOWN@@ a collection for the headquarters centrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year 
 sotheby 's the auction house founded in london N and now under the @@UNKNOWN@@ of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it @@UNKNOWN@@ to build its u.s. business 
 european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which sotheby 's north america had lately been touting in this country

 the state @@UNKNOWN@@ noted that @@UNKNOWN@@ banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the @@UNKNOWN@@ to mr. paul govern yourself @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the state agency was particularly @@UNKNOWN@@ to learn that the rubens and a @@UNKNOWN@@ other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and @@UNKNOWN@@ were actually hanging in the chairman 's house

 for instance he got a $ N million loan from the s&l negotiated at a @@UNKNOWN@@ rate 
 he owns N N of centrust 's shares 
 adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection 
 the $ N million @@UNKNOWN@@ on the rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its @@UNKNOWN@@

 the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains investment bankers and retailers said 
 managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies 
 the chains include bloomingdale 's owned by campeau corp. toronto saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's owned by b.a.t industries plc london and b. altman & co. and @@UNKNOWN@@ inc. owned by hooker corp. which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 hooker is based in sydney australia 
 the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & @@UNKNOWN@@ inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said 
 the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said bruce rosenthal a new york investment banker with nathan s. @@UNKNOWN@@ & co 
 investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either 
 earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. rosenthal added 
 those days are over now he believes 
 competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal 
 but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo 
 bankers believed in the @@UNKNOWN@@ theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more 
 this is no longer true today 
 at saks fifth avenue paul @@UNKNOWN@@ senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo 
 having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 it would also help us in our search for equity partners 
 to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds 
 none believe the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which is under chapter N bankruptcy protection 
 not only could the wall street gyrations damp christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger @@UNKNOWN@@ and greater management equity participation 
 further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be @@UNKNOWN@@ to consider additional retailing investments 
 it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned 
 however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt 
 in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues 
 what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said joseph e. brooks chairman and chief executive officer of ann taylor inc. a specialty chain 
 retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies 
 still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in @@UNKNOWN@@ in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the federated and allied units of campeau 
 prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said @@UNKNOWN@@ harrison chairman of @@UNKNOWN@@ inc. an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions 
 but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved 
 potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past

 ferc 's regulation had given pipelines until march N N to pass on to customers as much as N N of the costs of buying out their broken contracts which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short 
 a majority of old contracts were @@UNKNOWN@@ by the deadline and settled at steep discounts 
 but pipeline companies estimate they still face $ N billion in liabilities from @@UNKNOWN@@ disputes including $ N billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers 
 according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism 
 the court left open whether ferc could @@UNKNOWN@@ a new deadline later 
 the court agreeing with pipeline companies found the march N deadline was @@UNKNOWN@@ and @@UNKNOWN@@ and highly @@UNKNOWN@@ to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old @@UNKNOWN@@ contracts to meet the deadline

 polaroid corp. 's @@UNKNOWN@@ damages case against eastman kodak co. one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever is getting @@UNKNOWN@@ attention on wall street 
 after N days of @@UNKNOWN@@ testimony in federal court in boston the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys 
 most have read the pre-trial documents however and estimate kodak will be ordered to pay $ N billion to $ N billion for @@UNKNOWN@@ on seven polaroid patents 
 that may be the largest patent award ever but it is well below the $ N billion polaroid seeks 
 the highest patent damage award to date was in N when smith international inc. was ordered to pay $ N million to baker hughes inc. for @@UNKNOWN@@ on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal 
 the two companies later agreed to settle for $ N million 
 few analysts think it is worth their time to @@UNKNOWN@@ through the polaroid trial testimony 
 it 's like @@UNKNOWN@@ for gold outside of grand central station 
 you might find something but the chances are low said michael @@UNKNOWN@@ an analyst at wertheim schroder & co 
 and eugene glazer an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc. said if you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a prediction of the eventual award i would be willing to bet that he would be off by a lot 
 a @@UNKNOWN@@ trial in the early 1980s determined that kodak based in rochester n.y. infringed on patents of polaroid of cambridge mass 
 the main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was willful and @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 if so the damages could be tripled 
 two analysts who have read the @@UNKNOWN@@ david nelson of shearson lehman hutton inc. and @@UNKNOWN@@ d. @@UNKNOWN@@ a litigation analyst at @@UNKNOWN@@ simpson & co. think judge a. david @@UNKNOWN@@ will decide in kodak 's favor on the willful and @@UNKNOWN@@ issue 
 mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ said testimony by kodak 's patent counsel francis t. carr of @@UNKNOWN@@ & @@UNKNOWN@@ showed that he worked with kodak @@UNKNOWN@@ from the outset of the project in an effort to avoid infringement 
 carr told kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of polaroid 's patent positions and kodak followed his advice in every instance mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ said 
 but irving @@UNKNOWN@@ a patent expert at george mason university school of law who is familiar with the case said the fact that seven patents were infringed suggests that infringement was willful 
 it 's difficult to be that consistently wrong 
 observers also wonder whether judge @@UNKNOWN@@ will use the @@UNKNOWN@@ method of determining damages which polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award or the reasonable royalty method 
 polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by kodak if kodak had n't entered the market 
 moreover polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price and thus made higher profits because it would n't have been forced to match kodak 's lower prices 
 each side has called a harvard business school professor to testify on that issue 
 kodak hired robert @@UNKNOWN@@ and polaroid brought in robert j. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 there 's nothing that says that people at harvard business school have to agree with each other said mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 testimony is expected to continue until early december

 chicago options traders were among the big victims of friday 's plunging stock market including one small firm that required an emergency $ N million bailout 
 while monday 's rebounding markets helped other investors recoup losses many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with multimillion-dollar losses traders here and in new york said 
 options traders were hurt worse than others on friday because of the highly volatile nature of options which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based 
 thus options traders friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in new york

 options traders who in return for a small fee or premium had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling

 the latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the chicago board options exchange which has never fully recovered from the @@UNKNOWN@@ of black monday when investors fled the market because of huge losses 
 making matters worse was the fact that late friday afternoon the cboe halted stock-index options trading in step with the chicago mercantile exchange 's halt in stock-index futures

 i think the market is in good shape 
 should you really own stocks 
 that 's a question a lot of people are asking following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ financially and @@UNKNOWN@@ by friday 's @@UNKNOWN@@ 190-point drop in the dow jones industrial average and yesterday 's @@UNKNOWN@@ rebound they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market 
 the answer say academic researchers money managers and investment specialists is yes as long as you approach the stock market as an investor 
 but they say people should n't try to be traders who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock 
 the case for owning stocks over the long-term is compelling 
 if you look at N years worth of investment history including the great depression and every bear market since stocks have outperformed almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot says barry berlin vice president at first wachovia capital management 
 a dollar invested in the stock market in N would have grown to $ N by the end of last june according to laurence @@UNKNOWN@@ managing director at @@UNKNOWN@@ associates inc 
 but a dollar invested in long-term bonds in N would have grown to only $ N and a dollar put in treasury bills would equal a @@UNKNOWN@@ $ N 
 the longer the time period the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market 
 over time the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio 
 for instance ken gregory a san francisco money manager @@UNKNOWN@@ that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the standard & poor 's 500-stock index the chance of losing money is N N to N N over a 10-year period compared with N N over three years and N N over one year 
 if you do n't need the money for N years there 's a @@UNKNOWN@@ case for sticking to a steady core of stocks mr. gregory says 
 stock-market investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns says john @@UNKNOWN@@ jr. president of the institute of certified financial planners 
 stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate bonds international securities and cash he says 
 there are some important @@UNKNOWN@@ before investing in stocks individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank most investment advisers say 
 individuals also should focus on building equity in a home which provides some protection against inflation as well as a @@UNKNOWN@@ that can be @@UNKNOWN@@ in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living 
 people also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future for example for college tuition payments or retirement expenses 
 you may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge says mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ a del @@UNKNOWN@@ calif. financial planner 
 but once the @@UNKNOWN@@ are covered then i would start to invest even if it 's as little as $ N says michael lipper president of lipper analytical services inc 
 he says individuals should consider not just stocks but other long-term investments such as high-quality bonds 
 despite the strong case for stocks however most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments 
 it 's very difficult to do says donald holt a market strategist for @@UNKNOWN@@ morgan securities a los angeles brokerage firm 
 our markets move so fast and they are so volatile there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros 
 individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market 
 the cost of executing stock orders @@UNKNOWN@@ from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order but N N of the order 's value is an average says stephen boesel manager of t. rowe price 's growth and income mutual fund 
 and assuming their first investment is successful investors will have to pay taxes on their gains 
 that can reduce returns by a third or more once local taxes are included mr. lipper says 
 after that individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing 
 it 's very tough for most individuals to @@UNKNOWN@@ the mutual funds or the market says mr. lipper 
 you should really think twice if you think you can @@UNKNOWN@@ the system 
 then too many individual investors lack the @@UNKNOWN@@ emotional makeup professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market 
 so what 's the best way to buy stocks 
 unless an individual has a minimum of between $ N and $ N to invest in stocks he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks in terms of getting enough attention from a competent broker says mr. lipper 
 still he adds i could see owning both given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in @@UNKNOWN@@ special situations based on their own @@UNKNOWN@@ he adds 
 george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc. says that individuals have a particular edge now in small to @@UNKNOWN@@ niche companies with exciting earnings prospects a traditional @@UNKNOWN@@ ground for small investors 
 this growth sector which usually carries a @@UNKNOWN@@ multiple about twice that of the standard & poor 's N happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now 
 it 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market says mr. douglas 
 moreover mr. douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term 
 many big wall street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now @@UNKNOWN@@ coverage of this area he notes 
 we 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks he says 
 the pros @@UNKNOWN@@ advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment fad 
 they say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle when there 's no robust bull market to bail investors out of their mistakes 
 friday 's correction presents a pretty good buying opportunity but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle says @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ chief equity portfolio strategist at first boston corp 
 buy stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals he says 
 in the long run investment advisers say most investors will be better off using the @@UNKNOWN@@ averaging method of buying stocks 
 in this method a person invests a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down 
 that cuts the risk mr. gregory the san francisco money manager points out 
 when the market is low you are buying more shares and when it 's high you 're buying fewer shares he says 
 otherwise if you put all your money in at one time by sheer bad luck you might pick a terrible time and have to wait three years to get even mr. gregory says 
 a disciplined program will work the best mr. boesel says 
 one of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down he says 
 but that 's just the time when you should be buying them

 after reaching an intraday high of $ N the day mr. trump disclosed his bid oct. N amr 's stock had retreated as low as $ N last week

 he 's done this thing where he 'll buy a little bit of a company and then trade out of it 
 he 's written this book the art of the deal 
 why does n't he just follow through on one of these things 
 mr. trump withdrew his bid before the amr board which is due to meet tomorrow ever formally considered it 
 amr had weighed a wide range of possible responses from flat rejection to @@UNKNOWN@@ and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees a @@UNKNOWN@@ buyer such as texas billionaire robert bass or both 
 amr had also sought to @@UNKNOWN@@ mr. trump in congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the transportation department to reject airline buy-outs 
 yesterday mr. trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the ual deal on congress saying it was rushing through a bill to protect amr executives 
 i believe that the perception that legislation in this area may be hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the ual transaction and the resulting disruption in the financial markets experienced this past friday mr. trump wrote members of congress 
 amr declined to comment and mr. trump did n't respond to requests for interviews 
 mr. trump never said how much amr stock he had bought only that his holdings were substantial 
 however he only received federal clearance to buy more than $ N million of the stock on sept. N when the price rose $ N a share to $ N 
 between then and his bid on oct. N the price @@UNKNOWN@@ between $ N and $ N 
 in an attempt to persuade investors that his bid was n't just a stock play mr. trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares 
 amr was trading at around $ N yesterday before his withdrawal announcement then immediately fell to about $ N 
 assuming that he paid a rough average price of $ N a share and assuming he did n't sell before his announcement reached the market mr. trump could be sitting with a modest loss with the stock at $ N 
 some analysts said amr chairman robert crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation 's largest airline with a defensive transaction such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees 
 however other knowledgeable observers said they believed mr. crandall and the amr board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps 
 some analysts said they believed mr. trump whose @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ had been viewed by some as a reason to believe he would n't back out might come back with a lower bid

 at $ N a share the group would have to borrow about $ N billion from banks 
 the first ual deal unraveled after citibank and chase could n't raise $ N billion 
 citibank and chase had agreed to commit $ N billion and said they were highly confident of raising another $ N billion 
 together citicorp and chase received $ N million in fees to raise the rest of the financing 
 but other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the ual group was willing to pay them 
 officials familiar with the bank talks said the ual buy-out group ual pilots management and british airways plc is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest but is n't likely to boost its $ N million equity contribution 
 nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next N hours despite the hopes of many traders 
 the group 's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around 
 even if the buy-out group is able to obtain financing the transaction still faces obstacles 
 ual 's board could reject the new price as too low especially since there are n't any competing bids

 the pilots could play @@UNKNOWN@@ by noting they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes

 the house aviation subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major u.s. airlines 
 the collapsed plan to acquire ual corp. parent of united airlines spurred quick action on the legislation introduced wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday 
 the bill is expected to be taken up by the public works and transportation committee tomorrow and a floor vote by next week will be urged 
 the measure drew criticism from the bush administration and a @@UNKNOWN@@ shot from financier donald trump who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for amr corp. the parent of american airlines

 @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ deputy transportation secretary also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill in its present form 
 rep. @@UNKNOWN@@ brushed off mr. trump 's allegations as an excuse for his own deal failing

 mr. @@UNKNOWN@@ and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation

 supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and @@UNKNOWN@@ to the @@UNKNOWN@@ process and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry 
 in general the bill would give the transportation department a 30-day review period before N N or more of the voting stock of a major u.s. air carrier could be acquired 
 it also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition 
 the bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets or give control to a foreign interest 
 if more information is needed the secretary would have authority to extend the review period N days

 what happened friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently @@UNKNOWN@@ to handle another @@UNKNOWN@@ in prices 
 no @@UNKNOWN@@ with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling 
 but markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency 
 after the N plunge markets agreed that it would be @@UNKNOWN@@ to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose 
 the new york stock exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers if the dow jones index falls N points in a day the exchange will halt trading for one hour if the decline hits N points the exchange will close for an additional two hours 
 the rationale is that an @@UNKNOWN@@ of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels 
 it is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic 
 a temporary @@UNKNOWN@@ of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself 
 but there is also the possibility that @@UNKNOWN@@ down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices 
 what happened friday was the worst of all @@UNKNOWN@@ 
 the futures exchanges followed their own @@UNKNOWN@@ circuit breakers and shut down at about N p.m. for N minutes after the standard & poor 's N stock index had fallen N points or about N points on the dow jones index 
 options markets stopped trading in many securities 
 the new york stock exchange under its own rules remained open 
 with nowhere else to go sellers and particularly program traders focused all their selling on the new york stock exchange 
 as liquidity on that market weakened prices fell sharply 
 had the futures and options markets been open additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline most probably would have been less intense 
 at N after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and washington the futures exchanges reopened 
 futures trading however was halted altogether at N after the futures markets had dropped an additional N points which is the daily limit for price declines 
 at this point the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the new york stock exchange 
 it is time to recognize that the new york stock exchange the futures markets and the options markets though @@UNKNOWN@@ separate have actually become so closely @@UNKNOWN@@ as to constitute one market effectively 
 traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them 
 it therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers 
 to achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility either all markets should be open to trading or none 
 @@UNKNOWN@@ circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on friday but they probably would have made for @@UNKNOWN@@ less volatile executions 
 it 's time for the exchanges and the securities and exchange commission to agree on joint conditions for @@UNKNOWN@@ trading or staying open 
 let 's not have one market shut down for N minutes when the dow declines N points and another shut down for an hour after a @@UNKNOWN@@ decline 
 the need for @@UNKNOWN@@ last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that @@UNKNOWN@@ circuit breakers in all markets 
 the new circuit breakers if they are to be applied at all will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the new york stock exchange remains open 
 the rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies 
 should the sec and the commodities futures trading commission which with the sec @@UNKNOWN@@ the chicago stock-index markets be unable to agree the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the treasury secretary 
 in many ways our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago

 commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge friday

 gold the traditional haven in times of financial crisis continued its @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ with the dollar rising early in the day as the currency fell and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered 
 copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy 
 copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved 
 crude oil declined early but as the stock market retained early gains it too became stronger ending with a small net loss 
 trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines 
 in chicago grain and soybean prices rose slightly 
 livestock and meat prices however dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork

 britain 's blue arrow plc intends to change its name to manpower plc and write off a chunk of the nearly $ N billion in good will realized in the takeover of @@UNKNOWN@@ manpower inc 
 blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to @@UNKNOWN@@ the world 's biggest @@UNKNOWN@@ group in the u.s. 
 mr. fromstein disclosed the planned steps expected within a few months as blue arrow posted a N N drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings 
 the name change and good will write-off could help @@UNKNOWN@@ blue arrow 's dominance of the u.s. @@UNKNOWN@@ market and give it a more american image as u.s. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after friday 's market plunge 
 u.s. holders now own more than N N of blue arrow compared with N N last january

 the moves also could @@UNKNOWN@@ shareholders ' perception of blue arrow as a company in turmoil 
 it further @@UNKNOWN@@ the concept that blue arrow is a thing of the past said doug arthur an analyst at kidder peabody & co. in new york 
 the proposed changes all make a lot of sense to me he added 
 in a widely publicized @@UNKNOWN@@ coup mr. fromstein ousted @@UNKNOWN@@ berry as blue arrow chief executive in january a month after mr. berry had forced mr. fromstein out as the $ N @@UNKNOWN@@ chief of @@UNKNOWN@@ manpower 
 mr. fromstein @@UNKNOWN@@ his control in april by taking over from mr. berry as chairman 
 but the blue arrow @@UNKNOWN@@ is n't over yet as the british government is investigating a disputed # N million $ N million loan which mr. fromstein has said was made under mr. berry 's direction 
 blue arrow was able to pull off the $ N billion takeover of manpower in N largely because different british and american accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for british companies 
 under british rules blue arrow was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will arising from the purchase 
 as a @@UNKNOWN@@ company blue arrow would have to @@UNKNOWN@@ the good will over as many as N years creating a continuing drag on reported earnings 
 good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets 
 but with so many shares now held in the u.s. blue arrow reports its earnings two ways based on both u.k. and u.s. accounting standards 
 our balance sheets look like they came from alice 's @@UNKNOWN@@ mr. fromstein said 
 the british version shows a handful of pounds of net worth following the N write-off of good will while the american version reflects $ N billion of net worth because almost none of the good will has been written off 
 mr. fromstein said he hopes to @@UNKNOWN@@ some of the good will left on blue arrow 's u.s. books in one fell @@UNKNOWN@@ but would n't specify how much 
 people close to blue arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk with executives claiming prior management @@UNKNOWN@@ the extent of manpower 's good will 
 that move along with the return to the manpower name could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help 
 the number of u.s. temporary workers fell about N N in the N months ending aug. N after sliding nearly N N in july said kidder peabody 's mr. arthur

 richard g. sim the man credited with @@UNKNOWN@@ applied power inc. from an @@UNKNOWN@@ into a @@UNKNOWN@@ player in the global market for @@UNKNOWN@@ tools hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition barry wright corp

 barry wright acquired by applied for $ N million makes @@UNKNOWN@@ equipment and @@UNKNOWN@@ systems 
 the @@UNKNOWN@@ mass. company 's sales have been @@UNKNOWN@@ and its profits have dropped 
 last year 's earnings of $ N million including $ N from a restructuring gain were far below the year-earlier $ N million

 the question is how long it 's going to take barry wright to make a contribution says f. john @@UNKNOWN@@ an analyst at blunt ellis @@UNKNOWN@@ in milwaukee 
 the answer will help determine whether applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by mr. sim 
 the butler wis. manufacturer went public at $ N a share in august N and mr. sim 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N 
 strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule in august N 
 the stock has since @@UNKNOWN@@ trading around $ N a share last week and closing yesterday at $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 but mr. sim has set a fresh target of $ N a share by the end of 
 reaching that goal says robert t. @@UNKNOWN@@ applied 's chief financial officer will require efficient reinvestment of cash by applied and @@UNKNOWN@@ of its healthy N N rate of return on operating capital 
 in barry wright mr. sim sees a situation very similar to the one he faced when he joined applied as president and chief operating officer in N 
 applied then a closely held company was @@UNKNOWN@@ under the management of its controlling family 
 while profitable it was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital he says 
 mr. sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at barry wright as it has at applied 
 he also @@UNKNOWN@@ an @@UNKNOWN@@ @@UNKNOWN@@ to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where @@UNKNOWN@@ is shared 
 mr. sim considers the new unit 's operations fundamentally sound and adds that barry wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors 
 with a little patience these businesses will perform very @@UNKNOWN@@ mr. sim says 
 within about six months things will be moving in the right direction he predicts 
 mr. sim figures it will be easier to turn barry wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat 
 when he came to applied i did n't have the power to execute as i do today he says 
 he was named chief executive officer of applied in N and became chairman last november 
 at applied mr. sim set growth as his first objective 
 he took the company public in an offering that @@UNKNOWN@@ applied about $ N million which helped launch the company 's acquisition program 
 sales climbed to an estimated $ N million in fiscal N ended aug. N from $ N million in fiscal N 
 the company expects that earnings which have marched steadily upward in recent years reached about $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year just ended up from $ N million in fiscal N and $ N million in N
